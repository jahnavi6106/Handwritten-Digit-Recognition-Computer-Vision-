# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Computer-Vision-
Implemented CNN on MNIST dataset for digit classification.  Designed deep learning model with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense layers.
##  Overview
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.  
It is a classic **Computer Vision** deep learning problem with very high accuracy.  

##  Tech Stack
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Matplotlib  

##  Dataset
- Dataset: MNIST (automatically downloaded via Keras)  
- Input: 28x28 grayscale handwritten digits  
- Output: Predicted digit (0–9)
